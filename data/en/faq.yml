  - question: "Q. How can contact the law firm?"
    answer: >
            The best way to book an appointment is to use the booking tool or send me an e-mail. The first non-binding contact is of course free of charge.
  - question: "Q. Where can I represent you?"
    answer: >
            I am a registered attorney in the Basel Bar Register and a member of the Swiss and Basel Bar Associations and admitted to represent clients before all courts and authorities in Switzerland.
  - question: "Q. What is the purpose of the first client meeting?"
    answer: >
            We will clarify our mutual expectations during our first contact. The best way to do this is to describe the facts of the case and the desired objective. I can then give you a personal assessment of the chances of success based on the facts you have described and explain the conditions under which I can take on the assignment. It is essential for my work to develop a feeling for the client's interests and way of thinking. This requires an initial meeting. This can take place in person or by video conference. I also offer appointments at off-peak times.
