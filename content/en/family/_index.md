Nothing is more stressful and painful than ruptures, irreconcilable conflicts and the associated uncertainties in the family environment. Sensitive life situations require sensitive, prudent and at the same time professional and swift action. Precisely because family conflicts are often existentially very stressful, it is worth placing your own interests in experienced and level-headed hands.

I will be happy to provide you with comprehensive advice and work with you to define a strategy that does justice to your interests. My aim is to avoid unnecessarily prolonging family disputes and driving up costs. My motto is therefore: to achieve a fair solution for my client and not to escalate the situation unnecessarily.

In addition to traditional matrimonial and family law, I am also happy to represent you before the child and adult protection authorities. For many years, I have successfully represented people who have come into conflict with the authorities for various reasons. Quick reactions are often necessary here, so please do not hesitate to contact me.
