My name ist Christina Winter, born in 1991 in Bern, married and a mother of two. I have successfully completed my legal education at the Universities of St. Gallen, Basel, Zurich and Maastricht (NL).

I was then admitted to the bar in the Canton of Lucerne, where I worked at the Lucerne Labor Court and in a law firm specializing in employment law. As a lawyer, I initially worked for two years in the employment law team of a major international law firm in Zurich and then worked for a smaller Zurich law firm specializing in employment law. During my studies, I was employed at the St. Gallen Chair of Labor Law, with which I am still associated today. I regularly publish and give lectures on current employment law challenges.

My professional ethos is characterized by efficiency and thoroughness on the one hand and the joy of direct client contact on the other. As a lawyer, I thrive on the trust of my clients. Anyone who entrusts me with their matter must and may rely on the fact that it will be handled competently, carefully, quickly and transparently in terms of costs. That is why I only take on mandates in areas of law in which I can guarantee the corresponding reliability.
