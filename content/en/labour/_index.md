## Labour Law for Employees

Work plays an important role in our lives. People who work full-time often spend more waking hours a day in the environment of their job than with their own family. Conflicts at work are therefore one of the most stressful experiences in our everyday lives. Many things can be resolved with common sense. Often, however, especially when the parties involved fail to fulfill their duties, legal action is unavoidable.

Workplace bullying, questionable dismissals, unfair references and embezzled bonus entitlements are not uncommon. If you have a well-founded suspicion that your rights as an employee are being disregarded, you are welcome to contact me. I will examine your case in detail, give you an immediate assessment and discuss further steps with you.
